# Asset Management Policy for Road Lighting, Traffic Signals and Associated Electrical Assets

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Asset Management Policy is to set out the governing principles and commitments for managing street lighting, traffic signals and associated electrical assets on the national road network. It provides a consistent framework for decision-making across planning, acquisition, operation, maintenance, renewal and disposal of these assets.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All road-lighting assets, traffic-signal assets and associated electrical facilities falling under the jurisdiction of the Roads Directorate.
- All directorates, units, staff and contractors who plan, design, install, operate, maintain, renew or dispose of such assets.
- All stages of the asset lifecycle, including conceptual planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, renewal and decommissioning.

## 3. Policy Principles

### 3.1 Safety and Legal Compliance

1. The safety of road users, staff, contractors and the public shall be the overriding priority in all asset-related decisions.
2. Asset management shall comply with applicable national legislation, including:
   - Road traffic and road-safety legislation and regulations.
   - Occupational safety and health legislation and regulations.
   - Electricity supply, metering and safety regulations.
3. Where applicable technical standards, codes of practice or guidelines exist (for example for road lighting, traffic-signal design or electrical installations), they shall be adopted, adapted or referenced in specifications and internal standards.

### 3.2 Lifecycle and Risk-Based Management

4. Assets shall be managed using a lifecycle approach that considers total cost of ownership, rather than initial capital cost alone.
5. Asset-related decisions shall be based on structured assessment of risk, considering likelihood and consequences of failure in terms of safety, service performance, environment and cost.
6. Lifecycle strategies shall be documented for major asset classes and reviewed periodically.

### 3.3 Performance and Levels of Service

7. Target levels of service for availability and performance of street lighting and traffic signals shall be defined, documented and agreed with senior management.
8. Key performance indicators (KPIs) shall be established and monitored, including availability, mean time to repair (MTTR), compliance with response times, energy use and customer feedback.
9. Where performance consistently falls short of targets, corrective actions and improvement plans shall be defined, implemented, and tracked.

### 3.4 Data, Evidence and Traceability

10. Asset management decisions shall be supported by the best available data and analysis, including asset condition, failures, costs, energy use and safety outcomes.
11. Minimum data requirements shall be defined for each asset class, and operational systems shall be configured to capture and maintain this data.
12. Significant decisions (for example major renewals, technology changes, standard updates) shall be documented in a manner that allows traceability from the decision back to data, analysis and approvals.

### 3.5 Coordination and Stakeholder Engagement

13. Asset management shall be coordinated with internal and external stakeholders identified in ERAGS-DOC-STK-001, including funding authorities, utilities, traffic police, municipalities, contractors and the public.
14. Feedback from operations staff, road users and communities shall be considered in setting priorities and reviewing levels of service.

### 3.6 Energy Efficiency and Environmental Responsibility

15. Energy consumption and environmental impact shall be taken into account in asset strategies and investment decisions.
16. Where feasible and justified by risk and lifecycle analysis, energy-efficient technologies and control strategies (for example LED luminaires and adaptive lighting controls) shall be adopted.

### 3.7 Continuous Improvement

17. Asset management practices shall be periodically reviewed and improved, informed by:
   - Performance trends and KPI results.
   - Incident and failure investigations.
   - Technological developments and evolving standards.
   - Lessons learned from projects and operations.

## 4. Implementation

This Policy shall be implemented through:

- The **Lighting and Signals Asset Strategy** (ERAGS-DOC-STR-001), which translates policy principles into concrete lifecycle strategies and programmes.
- Governance processes defined in the **Governance Process Overview** (ERAGS-DOC-PROC-OV-001) and detailed process documents in the `/processes` folder.
- Requirements defined in the ERAGS High-Level Requirements Specification in the `/requirements` folder.
- Supporting models, data definitions and analytics defined in the `/models`, `/data` and `/qa` folders.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Roads Directorate Executive Management** is accountable for adopting and periodically reviewing this Policy.
- **Director – Roads Network Maintenance** is responsible for ensuring that this Policy is implemented within the road-network maintenance functions.
- **Electrical Engineer – Roads Electrical Sub-Section** is responsible for maintaining this Policy, ensuring alignment with laws and standards, and leading its implementation in governance processes, requirements and models.
- **Operations Staff, Contractors and Consultants** shall comply with this Policy and associated standards and procedures in all relevant activities.

## 6. Review and Revision

This Policy shall be reviewed:

- At least every three (3) years; or
- Earlier if there are significant changes in legislation, organisational objectives, funding context, technologies or asset performance.

Revisions shall be processed in accordance with the governance change-control processes described in ERAGS-DOC-PROC-OV-001 and shall be recorded with updated version and approval details.

## 7. Relationship to Other ERAGS Documents

- This Policy is grounded in the context described in ERAGS-DOC-CTX-001 and stakeholder roles in ERAGS-DOC-STK-001.
- It is implemented through ERAGS-DOC-STR-001 (Asset Strategy) and the governance processes described in ERAGS-DOC-PROC-OV-001.
- Terms used in this Policy are defined in ERAGS-DOC-REF-001 (Glossary and Abbreviations).
