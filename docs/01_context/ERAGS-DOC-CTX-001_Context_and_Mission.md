# Context and Mission for ERAGS

## 1. Purpose of this Document

This document describes the context and mission of the Electrical Roads Asset Governance & Strategy System (ERAGS). It provides the foundation for all governance, policy and strategy decisions affecting street lighting, traffic signals and associated electrical facilities on the national road network.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Asset Scope

ERAGS covers governance and strategy for the following asset classes:

- Road lighting assets:
  - Lighting columns and brackets
  - Luminaires and control gear
  - Feeder pillars, distribution boards and associated wiring
- Traffic signal assets:
  - Traffic signal heads and lanterns
  - Controllers, detection equipment and communication links
  - Signal poles, mast arms and foundations
  - Uninterruptible Power Supply units (UPS) where present
- Associated electrical facilities within the road reserve:
  - Junction boxes and cable ducts
  - Control cabinets for related roadside equipment

### 2.2 Geographic Scope

The geographic scope of ERAGS is the national road network under the jurisdiction of the Roads Directorate, including urban and rural roads and key intersections, as defined in the Roads Directorate Act and associated regulations.

## 3. Drivers and Constraints

### 3.1 Legal and Regulatory Drivers

Key legal and regulatory drivers include:

- Road safety obligations under road traffic legislation.
- Occupational safety and health obligations for staff and contractors.
- Electricity supply and metering regulations for public lighting and signals.
- Any national or regional energy-efficiency policies relating to public lighting.

These drivers establish minimum requirements and constraints for how road-lighting and traffic-signal assets must be planned, operated and maintained.

### 3.2 Organisational Drivers

Organisational drivers include:

- The mandate of the Roads Directorate to provide a safe, reliable and efficient road network.
- Expectations of the travelling public for safe night-time driving and clear traffic control.
- Budgetary constraints and the need to maximise value from limited funds.
- The need for transparency, accountability and defensible decision-making.

### 3.3 Technical and Operational Drivers

Technical and operational drivers include:

- The ageing condition of existing electrical infrastructure and legacy equipment.
- The transition from conventional lamps to LED technology and smart controls.
- The need to manage increasing traffic volumes and complex intersections.
- Risks from vandalism, theft and vehicle impacts on roadside equipment.

## 4. Mission Statement

The mission of ERAGS is:

> To provide a structured, transparent and data-driven governance framework that ensures street-lighting, traffic-signal and associated electrical assets on the national road network are safe, reliable, energy-efficient and cost-effective throughout their life cycle.

## 5. High-Level Objectives

ERAGS shall support the following high-level objectives:

1. **Safety** – minimise risks to road users and staff arising from electrical and traffic-signal assets.
2. **Availability and Reliability** – keep lighting and signal systems operational at defined target levels.
3. **Cost-Effectiveness** – apply lifecycle thinking to balance capital, operating and renewal costs.
4. **Compliance** – ensure adherence to applicable laws, standards and internal policies.
5. **Transparency and Traceability** – ensure that key decisions are based on documented analysis and can be traced to data, standards and approvals.
6. **Adaptability** – enable the asset base and governance processes to accommodate new technologies and changing requirements.

## 6. Relationship to Other ERAGS Documents

- Provides contextual background for the **Asset Management Policy** (ERAGS-DOC-POL-001).
- Supports identification of **stakeholder interests** in ERAGS-DOC-STK-001.
- Informs the **Lighting and Signals Asset Strategy** (ERAGS-DOC-STR-001).
- References terminology defined in the **Glossary and Abbreviations** (ERAGS-DOC-REF-001).

## 7. Assumptions and Dependencies

- Detailed implementation of processes, data models and system architectures is defined in the `/processes` and `/models` folders and their associated documents.
- Requirements derived from this context are recorded in the ERAGS High-Level Requirements Specification in `/requirements`.
